## [Box-Cox Transformation](#Box-Cox)

Some machine learning models assume data is normally distributed. Therefore, results will be biased when this assumption is not met. The unequal variance in a data is called heteroscedasticity. Higher variance in certain data points will make those estimation erros larger and push a model to fit those points. 

A Box-Cox transformation, is one of the methods that can deal with heteroscedasticity. This approach is a logarithmic transformation, that shrinks the larger range to reduce its variability and stretches out smaller range to enlarge its variability. 

The idea is to find best value of ![lambda](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clambda):

t(y), or transform vector of Y, so that it can become closer to normal distribution. 

![Power Transformation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t%28y%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%28y%5E%7B%5Clambda%7D-1%29%7D%7B%5Clambda%20%7D)





We can use Q-Q plot to check if we need any transformation.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/NothinBetterToDo/Analytics-Modeling/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block
