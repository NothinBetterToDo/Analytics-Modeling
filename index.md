## [Box-Cox Transformation](#Box-Cox)

Some machine learning models assume data is normally distributed. Therefore, results will be biased when this assumption is not met. The unequal variance in a data is called heteroscedasticity. Higher variance in certain data points will make those estimation erros larger and push a model to fit those points. 

A Box-Cox transformation, is one of the methods that can deal with heteroscedasticity. This approach is a logarithmic transformation, that shrinks the larger range to reduce its variability and stretches out smaller range to enlarge its variability. 


The idea is to find best value of ![lambda](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clambda):

```markdown
t(y), or transform vector of Y, so that it can become closer to normal distribution. 
```
We will need to find the power transformation, lambda, that maximizes the likelihood when a 
specified set of explanatory variables is fitted to the following equation as the response: 

![Power Transformation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t%28y%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%28y%5E%7B%5Clambda%7D-1%29%7D%7B%5Clambda%20%7D)






The value of lambda can be positive or negative, but not zero. 

For lambda = 0, the Box-Cox transformation is defined as log(y). 

For lambda = -1, the formula:

![Example 1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7By%5E%7B-1%7D-1%7D%7B-1%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7By%7D%20-%201%7D%7B-1%7D%20%3D%201%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7By%7D)






We can use Q-Q plot to check if we need any transformation. 



## [De-Trending](#De-Trending) 

Trend: increase/decrease of data over time and a trend in a time-series could cause issue with a factor-based analysis. De-trending can be used on either response, or predictors. 

One method of de-trending by using 1-dimensional regression (linear fit):

## [PCA](#PCA) 

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique, when we have too many predictors and/or high correlction between some of the predictors. PCA transforms data, by changing the coordinates to remove correlation and ranking coordinates by importance (in order of the amount of variants). 

There are 2 benefits on concentrating on the first n principal components: 
- reduce effect of randomness
- earlier principal components are likely to have higher signal-to-noise ratio
